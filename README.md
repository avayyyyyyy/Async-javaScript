# Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript

## Synchronous Code

In synchronous JavaScript code execution, tasks are executed one after the other in a sequential manner. Each task waits for the previous one to complete before it starts. It blocks the execution of further code until the current task is finished.

Example:
```javascript
console.log("Hello");
console.log("World");
console.log("Goodbye");
Output:

Copy code
Hello
World
Goodbye
Asynchronous Code
In asynchronous JavaScript code execution, tasks are non-blocking, and multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously. The program does not wait for the completion of a particular task before moving on to the next one. Asynchronous code is beneficial when dealing with time-consuming operations or waiting for external resources.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async code");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
Output:

sql
Copy code
Start
End
Async code
When to Use Synchronous Code
Synchronous code is straightforward to read and understand. It is suitable for tasks that don't involve waiting for external resources and where operations can be executed one after the other without significant delays.

When to Use Asynchronous Code
Asynchronous code is essential when dealing with tasks that may take time to complete, such as fetching data from servers or reading files. By using asynchronous code, the application can continue processing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. This improves the overall performance and responsiveness of the program.

Remember to choose the appropriate approach based on the specific requirements of your program or application.
