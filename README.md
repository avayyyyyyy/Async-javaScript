# Understanding Synchronous and Asynchronous JavaScript

In JavaScript, the terms synchronous and asynchronous refer to how tasks are executed and how they interact with each other. Let's dive into the concepts and examples provided in the code to understand them better.

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

Synchronous code executes line by line, and each line must finish executing before the next line is executed. Asynchronous code, on the other hand, allows tasks to be executed independently, and the program does not wait for a task to complete before moving to the next one.

### Synchronous Code

In synchronous code, one task is completed before the next one starts. Here's an example:

```javascript
console.log("hello1");
console.log("hello2");
console.log("hello4");
// Output: hello1
//         hello2
//         hello4
```
### Asynchronous Code
In asynchronous code, tasks can run simultaneously without waiting for each other. Common ways to create asynchronous behavior are using setTimeout, fetch, axios, Promise, XMLHttpRequest, etc.

```javascript

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello bacho!");
}, 2000);
console.log("Hello bacho!2");
// Output: Hello bacho!2 (will be printed immediately)
//         Hello bacho! (after 2 seconds)
```
### Promises
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations and represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task. They have three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

```javascript
Copy code
let num = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (!true) {
    resolve();
  } else {
    reject();
  }
});

num
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Hogya");
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log("Nhi Hua");
  });
  ```
// Output: Nhi Hua
### Async/Await
async and await are used to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style. It allows you to write cleaner code by handling promises without chaining .then() and .catch().

```javascript
Copy code
async function getData() {****
  try {
    let raw = await fetch("https://randomuser.me/api/");
    let ans = await raw.json();
    console.log(ans);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error:", error);
  }
}
```
getData();
## Conclusion
In this README.md, we explored the differences between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript code. We learned how asynchronous code can be managed using promises and how to use async/await to make asynchronous code look more like synchronous code. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and responsive JavaScript applications
